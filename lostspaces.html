<h1>Let’s colour new horizons</h1> <br><br>
“De buitenwereld<br>
Lijkt in een doos te zitten<br>
Vanachter het scherm”<br><br>
The outside world<br>
Seems to be boxed up<br>
From behind the screen <br> <br>
My new morning ritual. I try to wrap up breakfast as soon as possible, unsuccessfully almost
every day. I take my coffee and tea, and open my laptop, if it wasn’t open already…
Then I stare at my screen, looking for the things I really miss. Somewhere in there is the
world that used to provide me with horizons offering me countless opportunities and
possibilities to explore and act upon. The horizons have turned into invasive peep boxes.
They seem to be always turned on even if the laptop is closed. After several attempts to
write or read, video calls, with accompanying network difficulties, miscommunications, but
also nice exchanges of thoughts and ideas, I look outside the window without really seeing
the actual horizon.<br><br>
This is me, living in a turbulent time, like all of us, that disturbs me and everyone else from
normality in many ways. The crisis forces us to adapt to a state of uncertainty in which we
try to find a new balance. When we follow Hannah Arendt, a crisis is simultaneously a
danger and a chance, &quot;that is the opportunity, provided by the very fact of crisis–which tears
away facades and obliterates prejudices–to explore and inquire into whatever has been laid
bare of the essence of the matter.&quot; Especially now that we are in times of crisis and isolation,
we should not panic and trust our reptilian brain, but keep the neocortex awake. But how do
we keep our heads cool, our minds clear and our gaze focused? How can we seize the
chances of the current crises? And moreover, how can the arts act upon this situation?<br><br>
To begin with, we need to find our own way back to our personal space, where we
experience life on a human scale. This means recognizing the basic need for the security of
private life within four walls. Whether it is a small student room or an apartment with a tiny
garden, it is the space we fill with our scent, we know by its sounds and noises, we decorate
with our personal belongings. Here we can talk out loud, act without thinking, without
feeling embarrassed. It is the space that resonates our identity, where we feel at home. As
Hannah Arendt describes ‘These four walls, within which people’s private family life is lived,
constitute a shield against the world and specifically against the public aspect of the world.
They enclose a secure place, without which no living thing can thrive.’ Only when I started
recognizing this secure personal place and started caring for what I can control from and
within it, I found a way to look beyond the zoom, skype and teams-boxes. And silence them
when needed, if only for the time being.<br><br>
Although listening has become increasingly present in our daily online communication
mode, the appeal of productivity, efficiency, accountability and protocols prevents us from
open listening. This way of open listening, where hearing becomes listening, starts with
becoming alert. As John Tebbutt describes: ‘Such ‘alertness’, might be characterized as a

listening for difference, for something new emerging from familiarity.’ (Tebbutt, 2009) It
makes room to let go of our own agendas, to see through the mores of the crisis and to be
genuinely interested in the other. Through the act of recognizing what others have to say,
we can connect as humans and give an account of our lives. Yes, we live and breathe and are
more than pawns in a massive machine that works to minimize the effects of the current
pandemic.<br><br>
It is not the people within the boxes who violate the privacy and freedom that we
experience within the comfort of our private lives. They are you and me. It is the way we
relate and connect that is a result and part of necessary precautions and measurements. The
crisis is creating an increasingly dens instrumentalization of our institutionalized world. The
paper world that was there before COVID-19, has become more apparent. However urgent
the new rules of life are, they are mostly devised on the drawing board, resulting in
generalizations that cannot meet the needs of every individual. Where in a pre-Corona time
individual cases within public life could offer counterbalance to protocols and regulations,
they are now more and more muted within 1,5 meters distance. As much as the Dutch
government tries to give responsibility to her citizens to respect and follow the new rules, it
restrains the care and responsibility of the roles we take in society. It applies every possible
instrument to think for the people out of care for the people, instead of with the people and
from within the nuanced complexities that arise from the current crisis. After all, a
government is not capable of listening to all the voices, culminating a loss of human scale.

Whether the artistic practice leads us to finding ourselves through a genuine dialogue or
acknowledging our personal space, or the other way around -the order does not really
matter- creating, making, using our imagination and creativity can keep us sane. From small
things like writing haiku’s, sketching in our diary or baking banana bread to developing
whole new projects or imagining painting a masterpiece; they all can trigger our alertness for
finding something new, or to see the familiar from a whole different perspective. Their
artistic practice can enable artists to reflect on and respond to the current situation, to look
ahead to the future, however abstract it may be. At least on a personal level. But moreover,
the arts can reach out to the wider world. Especially now we are covered with a blanked of
not knowing what the future will look like. Haunted by an invisible danger, from which there
is no escape: everyone experiences the effects and implications. Firmly grounded in their
personal sphere artists can start playing with new ways of communicating and making. From
an appreciation of what you have, you can let other people become more aware of what is
possible instead of what is not. Let us make plans ourselves, and through these inspire
others to make plans, however small, concrete or just in their minds. Due to the state of
isolation most of us are in, we miss the people we care about and become sometimes
painfully aware of the neglected relationships. Maybe now is the time to catch up with long
distance friends or look after our grandparents. As an example, I have spoken and seen my
friends who live all over the Netherlands and abroad more often than I have done in years.
But the arts can do more: through creating situations and spaces for exchanging and sharing
perspectives new ways of relating and connecting are made possible; not to think for
yourself and the for other, but to think from within our personal situation in relation to the
outside world from a position of care. Make people of all sorts part of experiencing life on a
human scale, instead of getting exhausted by the rules and ways of life that have been
imposed. This can be done in several ways, for instance when online communication is

approached as a tool or material to work with, like this conference shows. Develop online
performances and gatherings, send each other letters and drawings, or do something with
all those private spaces you get to peek into, which were not available before. Also, the
physical near environment can offer opportunities to make work. How can you play with
social distancing in a literal sense? What to think of the streets in your own neighbourhood
you know so well, can you engage people living in your streets in a work that turns their
perspective on living in the same street but in different worlds? Or what if we would make
1,5 meter crinolines and walk through a shopping district?<br>
Apart from the near future and dealing with the immediate effects of COVID-19, the arts can
take the lead into how to live in a world where living with the consequences of viruses is the
norm. The arts can address bigger issues like how we may need to rearrange our cities,
revalue rural areas, use new technologies to decrease global transport, produce locally. Not
to solve them, but to make imaginable how we can live in the future and encourage people
to care for the environment and contribute to a liveable planet. So, let’s create symbolic,
actual and virtual horizons and envision possible futures: let’s colour new horizons.
